## Introduction

<u>Objective: </u> Understand patterns and correlations between early predictors **Comorbidities and Etiologies**, their numerical estimate **CPS and Charlson index** and **cirrhosis' patients outcome**  

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Cirrhosis** = condition in which the liver is scarred and permanently damaged.

<u>Relevancy of the study: </u> Cirrhosis is a leading cause of mortality in the world (11th), and finding accurate descriptive index is a useful tool to investigate the possible outcome of patients.

## Materials - Dataset

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
<u> Data set used: </u> [Early predictors of outcomes of hospitalization for cirrhosis and assessment of the impact of race and ethnicity at safety-net hospitals](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.6gt88dv)

-   733 patients
-   From 4 safety-net hospitals in the US\
-   Male dominated study (67.31%)
-   Predominant age group \[60; 70\]
-   Main liver disease diagnosis
    -   Ascites (31%)
    -   Hepatic encephalopathy (21.2%)
    -   UGIB (19.9%)

## Methods

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
<b>Cleaning: </b>

-   Extracting, renaming, reordering columns
-   Dropping non-available values them

<b>Tidying:</b>

-   Pivot_wider on Comorbidities
-   Pivot_wider on Etiologies

<b>Augmenting:</b>

-   Created categories for Mortality: no death, death in hospital, after 30 days, after 90 days
-   Creating age bins instead decade

## Overview of comorbidities and etiologies

-   **Etiology** is the study of the factors that come together leading to a disease.

-   **Comorbidity** is an additional disease that can interact and coexist simultaneously with cirrhosis.

## Results: Different outcomes tendency depending on the liver disease

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
![](../results/plots/LD_Mortality.png){width="100%"}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Bar plot which shows liver disease distribution, filled by mortality status

-   Demonstrates the impact of varying mortality rates base on liver diseases

-   Reveals differences in mortality timing between "Other fluid overload" and "SNB"
:::

## Death ratios of every Etiology/Liver disease combination

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
![](../results/plots/Tile_plot_mortality.png){width="100%"}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Tile chart reveals ratios for liver diseases and associate etiologies

-   High mortality for specific combinations like Hepatic encephalopathy/Auto-immune hepatitis. 

-   Lower death ratios (<25%) for example for Hepatitis B or Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

-   Over representation of certain comorbidities

## Model 1 - Logistic regression

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}

![](../results/plots/mortality_CPS.png){width="80%"}

![](../results/plots/boxplot_logistic_confidence_interval.png){width="100%"}
:::


::: {.column width="30%"}

-   **Overview:** Logistic regression model

-   **Variables:** CPS & Mortality

-   **Results:** For every increased CPS unit, the likelihood for mortality increase by 50 %
:::
:::

## Model 2 - Linear regression

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
![](../results/plots/Significance_plot_CPS.png){width="100%"}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
-   **Overview:** Linear regression model

-   **Variables:** CPS & Etiologies

-   **Results:** Statistically significant result for nafld associated with low CPS
:::
:::

## Conclusion

-   The **type of the liver disease** notably impacts the patient's outcome 

-   The difference in timing (less or more fulgurant) hint a varying disease severity

-   Lethal combinations of liver diseases and their associated etiologies can be identified

-   For every CPS unit increase there is a 50 % higher likelihood for mortality

-   According to the linear regression nafld is associated with low CPS
