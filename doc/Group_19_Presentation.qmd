# Introduction {.smaller}

-   The purpose of our analysis is to understand patterns and correlations for early predictors (Comorbidities and Etiologies) of cirrhosis' patients mortality.

-   The dataset was taken from the study: Early predictors of outcomes of hospitalization for cirrhosis and assessment of the impact of race and ethnicity at safety-net hospitals

-   Cirrhosis is a condition in which the liver is scarred and permanently damaged. A liver that’s affected by cirrhosis is unable to function properly, which causes serious health problems.

-   In 2017, cirrhosis caused more than 1·32 million deaths, including 440,000 in females and 883,000 in males.

# Materials and Methods
## Definitions {.smaller}

-   Etiology is the study of the factors that come together leading to a disease.

-   Comorbidity is an additional disease that can interact and coexist simultaneously with cirrhosis.

-   Child-Pugh Score (CPS) for Cirrhosis Mortality: useful in the determination of the prognosis of patients suffering from cirrhosis.

-   Charlson Comorbidity Index: useful to predict the mortality of patients suffering from comorbidities.

## Data Wrangling - Cleaning and Augmenting {.smaller}

<b>Cleaning:</b>

-   Started by extracting necessary columns

-   Adding an ID column as a unique identifier for each observation

-   Renamed columns, reordered them, and assigned classes to etiology and comorbidities.

<b>Augmenting:</b>

-   Created categories for Mortality: no death, death in hospital, after 30 days, after 90 days.

-   Creating age bins instead decade
