## Introduction 

- Purpose of our analysis is to understand patterns and correlations of early predictors of (Comorbidities and Etiologies) of cirrhosis' patients mortality.   

-   Cirrhosis is a condition in which the liver is scarred and permanently damaged. A liver thatâ€™s affected by cirrhosis is unable to function properly, which causes serious health problems.   



## Materials - Dataset

::: {.column width="50%"}
Data set used: [Early predictors of outcomes of hospitalization for cirrhosis and assessment of the impact of race and ethnicity at safety-net hospitals](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.6gt88dv)   

<\div>

Study performed on X patients from 4 safety-net hospitals in the US    

Focused in the early predictors of outcomes like **comorbidities** and **etiologies**

## Methods

<b>Cleaning:</b>

-   Started by extracting necessary columns

-   Adding an ID column as a unique identifier for each observation

-   Renamed columns, reordered them, and assigned classes to etiology and comorbidities.

<b>tidying:</b>

<b>Augmenting:</b>

-   Created categories for Mortality: no death, death in hospital, after 30 days, after 90 days.

-   Creating age bins instead decade

## Overview of comorbidities and etiologies

-   **Etiology** is the study of the factors that come together leading to a disease.

-   **Comorbidity** is an additional disease that can interact and coexist simultaneously with cirrhosis.
