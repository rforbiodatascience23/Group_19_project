# Introduction

-   Cirrhosis is a condition in which the liver is scarred and permanently damaged.

-   A liver that’s affected by cirrhosis is unable to function properly, which causes serious health problems.

-   In 2017, cirrhosis caused more than 1·32 million deaths, including 440,000 in females and 883,000 in males.

# Materials and Methods

-   Etiology is the study of the factors that come together leading to a disease.

-   Comorbidity is an additional disease that can interact and coexist simultaneously with cirrhosis.

-   Child-Pugh Score (CPS) for Cirrhosis Mortality: useful in the determination of the prognosis of patients suffering from cirrhosis.
