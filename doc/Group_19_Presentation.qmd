## Introduction 

<u>Objective: </u> Understand patterns and correlations between early predictors **Comorbidities and Etiologies**, their numerical estimate **CPS and Charlson index** and **cirrhosis' patients outcome** \

**Cirrhosis** = condition in which the liver is scarred and permanently damaged.

## Introduction

-   Purpose of our analysis is to understand patterns and correlations of early predictors of (Comorbidities and Etiologies) of cirrhosis' patients mortality.

-   Cirrhosis is a condition in which the liver is scarred and permanently damaged. A liver that's affected by cirrhosis is unable to function properly, which causes serious health problems.

Data set used: [Early predictors of outcomes of hospitalization for cirrhosis and assessment of the impact of race and ethnicity at safety-net hospitals](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.6gt88dv)

<<<<<<< HEAD
- 733 patients 
- From 4 safety-net hospitals in the US    
- Male dominated study (67.31%)
- Predominant age group [60; 70]
- Main liver disease diagnosis 
* Ascites ()

## Methods

<b>Cleaning:</b>

-   Started by extracting necessary columns

-   Adding an ID column as a unique identifier for each observation

-   Renamed columns, reordered them, and assigned classes to etiology and comorbidities.

<b>tidying:</b>

<b>Augmenting:</b>

-   Created categories for Mortality: no death, death in hospital, after 30 days, after 90 days.

-   Creating age bins instead decade

## Overview of comorbidities and etiologies

-   **Etiology** is the study of the factors that come together leading to a disease.

-   **Comorbidity** is an additional disease that can interact and coexist simultaneously with cirrhosis.
