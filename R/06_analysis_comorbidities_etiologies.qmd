# Liver disease and comordities/etiologies relations

## Liver disease and Comorbidities

Seeking to understand the relation between comorbidities and the patient's liver
disease, it would be helpful to visualize if some liver diseases have peculiar 
relationships with some comorbidities. To do so, a tile plot with the variables
Liver disease, Comorbidities and ratio of patients of a certain liver disease
with comorbidities was created.

### Creation of a dataset with count of patients with same disease and same 
comorbidities

```{r}
grouped_LD_C <- dat_aug_03 |>
  group_by(Liver_disease, Comorbidities) |> 
  summarise(count = n()) |> 
  arrange(Liver_disease, desc(count)) 

grouped_LD_C
```

### Creation of a dataset with total count of patients with same disease

```{r}
grouped_LD <- dat_aug_03 |>
  group_by(Liver_disease) |> 
  summarise(count_LD = n())

grouped_LD
```

### Joining of the two dataset according to Liver_disease

```{r}
merged_dat1 <- inner_join(grouped_LD_C, grouped_LD, by = 'Liver_disease')

# Calculate the ratio of count to total count
merged_dat1 <- merged_dat1|>
  mutate(Ratio = count / count_LD)

merged_dat1
```

```{r}
tile_plot_comorb <- merged_dat1 |>
  ggplot(aes(Liver_disease, 
             Comorbidities)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill= Ratio))+
  labs(fill = "Ratio" ,
       title = "Proportions of comorbidities for each liver disease ",
       x = "Liver Disease",
       y = "Comorbidities") +
  scale_fill_viridis() +
  theme_classic()+ 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust=1), 
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.73, face = "bold", size = 14))

tile_plot_comorb
```

```{r}
ggsave("Tile_plot_comorbidities.png", 
       path = "../results/plots/",
       plot = tile_plot_comorb,
       width = 7,
       height = 5)
```


Each column adds up to 100%. From this graph, we can state that Moderate to
severe liver disease is an important comorbidities for all liver diseases. This 
comorbidity. meaning was left very vague in the study, so it is hard to give an 
actual explanation. However, what we can say is that close to 60% of patients 
suffering from a Hepato-hydrothorax have a moderate to severe liver diseasse in 
addition. A lot of Comorbidities are not clustered for a particular liver 
disease, except for Malignancy and Diabetes which seem to be present in around 
30% of patients suffering respectively from HCC and Jaundice. On the other side
of the spectrum Heiplegia/Paraplegia and Dementia have very low incidence in the
cirrhosis' patients population.

# Liver disease and etiology

After tackling the subject comorbidities that can enhance some cases of
cirrhosis, the etiology or causes of the liver disease is also a useful tool, 
both for treatment and prevention.

### Creation of a new dataset counting patients with same disease and same
etiology

```{r}
grouped_LD_E <- dat_aug_03 |> 
  group_by(Liver_disease, Etiologies) |> 
  summarise(count = n()) 

grouped_LD_E
```

### Joining of the two dataset according to Liver_disease

```{r}
merged_dat2 <- inner_join(grouped_LD_E, grouped_LD, by = 'Liver_disease')

# Calculate the ratio of count to total count
merged_dat2 <- merged_dat2|>
  mutate(Ratio = count / count_LD)

merged_dat2
```

```{r}
tile_plot_etiologies <- ggplot(merged_dat2, 
       aes(x = Liver_disease, 
           y = Etiologies, 
           fill = Ratio)) +
  geom_tile()+
  labs(title = "Proportions of etiologies for each liver disease",
       x = "Liver Disease",
       y = "Etiologies", 
       fill = "Percent of patients") + 
  scale_fill_viridis()+
  theme_classic()+ 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust=1), 
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.50, face = "bold", size = 13))

tile_plot_etiologies

```
```{r}
ggsave("Tile_plot_etiologies.png", 
       path = "../results/plots/",
       plot = tile_plot_etiologies,
       width = 7,
       height = 5)
```


Each column adds up to 100%.

From this tile chart, Hepathitis C and alcohol consumption appear like the two
main ethiologies for the liver disease, especially for Alcoholic hepatitis where
nearly 80% is caused by alcohol consumption. Hepathitis C is also responsible 
for half of the cases of HCC of patients in this study. Those two ethiologies
usually share the stage for each liver disease. Ascites, Hepatic encephalopathy
and UGIB have multiple etiologies possible at few percentages like Autoimmune
hepatitis, cryptogenic disease, Hepathitis B and Non Alcoholic fatty liver 
disease. However, Primary biliary cholangitis seems like a very rare etiology,
since it is only present in a very few percent (arouond 1%) for patients
suffering from Fluid overload.

# Does etiology have influences on the mortality of patients for he same liver
disease ?

```{r}
dat_aug_03_2 <- dat_aug_03 |> 
  filter(Mortality != 'No death') |> 
  group_by(Liver_disease, Etiologies, Mortality) |> 
  summarise(count2 = n())
dat_aug_03_2
```

```{r}
dat_aug_03_join <- left_join(grouped_LD_E, 
                             dat_aug_03_2, 
                             by = c("Liver_disease",
                                    "Etiologies"))
```

```{r}
dat_aug_03_join <- dat_aug_03_join |> 
  replace_na(list(count2 = 0))
```

```{r}
tile_plot_mortality <- ggplot(dat_aug_03_join, 
       aes(x = Liver_disease, 
           y = Etiologies, 
           fill = count2/count)) +
  geom_tile() +
  labs(title = "Death ratios of every Etiology/Liver disease combination ",
       x = "Liver Disease",
       y = "Etiologies", 
       fill = "Death ratio") +
  scale_fill_viridis()+
  theme_classic()+ 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust=1), 
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.50, face = "bold", size = 13))+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 14)) +
  theme(axis.text=element_text(size=12),
        axis.title=element_text(size=14,face="bold"))

tile_plot_mortality
```

```{r}
ggsave("Tile_plot_mortality.png", 
       path = "../results/plots/",
       plot = tile_plot_mortality,
       width = 7,
       height = 5)
```


After inspecting the etiologies associations with the liver diseases, we used 
the tile chart above to show the death ratio for each liver disease and its 
associated etiology. From this plot, we can deduce that all patients that 
suffered from Hepatic encephalopathy with auto-immune hepatitis died of 
cyrrhosis. The combination AKI/cryptogenic disease (70%), 
Hepato-hydrothorax/Alcohol-consumption (80%), Jaundice/Hepathitis C (80%) have 
the strongest deatah ratio. On the opposite, it seems that ethiologies like 
Hepathitis B, Non-alcoolic fatty liver disease and liver disease like Alcoholic 
hepatitis, Ascites, HCC, Fluid overload, SBP and UGIB have lower dath ratio 
(less thann 25%).

# Conclusion

After plotting the proportions of comorbidities and etiologies for each liver 
disease, we noticed that some of these are over represented, for instance the 
comorbidity "Moderate to severe liver disease", as well as the etiologies 
"Hepathitis C" and "Alcohol consumption". 
Moreover, by plotting a tile chart of the liver diseases and the etiologies that
takes the death ratio into account, we saw that some combinations of liver 
diseases and etiologies are particularly lethal, in particular the combination
of autoimmune-hepatitis and hepatic-encephalopathy.
